      "distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\n",
      "mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\n",
      "pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\n",
      "accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\n",
      "fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\n",
      "had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\n",
      "spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\n",
      "were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\n",
      "book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\n",
      "good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\n",
      "such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\n",
      "views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\n",
      "had a very different story to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\n",
      "delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\n",
      "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\n",
      "she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\n",
      "her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\n",
      "twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\n",
      "time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\n",
      "up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\n",
      "can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\n",
      "down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\n",
      "asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\n",
      "King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\n",
      "again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\n",
      "“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\n",
      "his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\n",

      "with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\n",

      "of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\n",
      "themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\n",

      "sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\n",
      "good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\n",

      "age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\n",
      "look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\n",
      "hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\n",
      "with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\n",
      "great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\n",
      "easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\n",
      "could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\n",
      "never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\n",
      "had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\n",
      "understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\n",
      "deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\n",
      "reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\n",

      "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\n",

      "in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\n",

      "everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\n",
      "though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\n",
      "in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\n",
      "was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\n",
      "to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\n",
      "which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\n",
      "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\n",
      "was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\n",
      "united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\n",

      "from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\n",
      "it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\n",

      "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n",
      "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\n",
      "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\n",

      "may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\n",
      "meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\n",
      "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\n",
      "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\n",
      "therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\n",

      "Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\n",
      "thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\n",
      "in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\n",
      "fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\n",
      "the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\n",
      "had left her four thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\n",
      "father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\n",
      "London in a respectable line of trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\n",
      "convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\n",
      "thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\n",
      "to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\n",
      "their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\n",
      "better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\n",
      "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\n",
      "news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\n",
      "some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\n",
      "with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\n",
      "the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\n",
      "the head-quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\n",
      "intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\n",
      "officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\n",
      "and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\n",
      "visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\n",
      "unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\n",
      "Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\n",

      "field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\n",
      "over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\n",
      "within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\n",
      "glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\n",
      "assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\n",
      "That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\n",
      "dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\n",
      "Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\n",
      "for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\n",
      "brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\n",
      "good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\n",
      "nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\n",
      "brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\n",
      "the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\n",
      "thinking only of his breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\n",
      "Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\n",
      "enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\n",
      "immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\n",
      "alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\n",
      "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\n",
      "however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\n",
      "could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\n",
      "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\n",
      "began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\n",
      "solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\n",
      "examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\n",
      "violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\n",
      "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n",
      "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\n",
      "ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\n",
      "the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\n",
      "nothing to do elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\n",
      "unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\n",

      "at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\n",
      "of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\n",

      "At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\n",

      "poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\n",
      "much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\n",

      "this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\n",
      "shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\n",
      "being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\n",
      "indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\n",
      "Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\n",
      "regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\n",
      "attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\n",
      "herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\n",
      "others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\n",
      "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\n",
      "Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\n",
      "eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\n",
      "dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\n",
      "began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\n",
      "pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\n",
      "she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\n",
      "thought the same, and added,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\n",
      "walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\n",
      "looked almost wild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\n",
      "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\n",
      "country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\n",
      "in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\n",
      "hide it not doing its office.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\n",
      "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\n",
      "when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\n",
      "escaped my notice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\n",
      "inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\n",
      "an exhibition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\n",
      "above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\n",
      "it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\n",
      "a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\n",
      "Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n",
      "“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\n",
      "eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\n",
      "short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\n",
      "girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\n",
      "a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\n",
      "chance of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\n",
      "Meryton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\n",
      "would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\n",
      "consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\n",
      "hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\n",
      "their dear friend’s vulgar relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\n",
      "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\n",
      "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\n",
      "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\n",
      "when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\n",
      "down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\n",
      "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\n",
      "them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\n",
      "excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\n",
      "below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\n",
      "reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\n",
      "am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\n",
      "I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\n",
      "where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\n",
      "others; all that his library afforded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\n",
      "credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\n",
      "than I ever looked into.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\n",
      "in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\n",
      "so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\n",
      "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\n",
      "generations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\n",
      "books.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\n",
      "these.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\n",
      "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\n",
      "half as delightful as Pemberley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish it may.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\n",
      "neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\n",
      "finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\n",
      "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\n",
      "attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\n",
      "the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\n",
      "sister, to observe the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\n",
      "she be as tall as I am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\n",
      "rather taller.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\n",
      "so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\n",
      "for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\n",
      "to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\n",
      "net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\n",
      "sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\n",
      "being informed that she was very accomplished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\n",
      "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\n",
      "otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\n",
      "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\n",
      "cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\n",
      "acquaintance that are really accomplished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\n",
      "idea of an accomplished woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\n",
      "esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\n",
      "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\n",
      "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\n",
      "this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\n",
      "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\n",
      "will be but half deserved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\n",
      "something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\n",
      "reading.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\n",
      "I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\n",
      "this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\n",
      "application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\n",
      "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\n",
      "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\n",
      "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\n",
      "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\n",
      "one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\n",
      "sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\n",
      "succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n",
      "“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\n",
      "to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\n",
      "despicable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\n",
      "continue the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\n",
      "that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\n",
      "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\n",
      "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\n",
      "eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\n",
      "unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\n",
      "that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\n",
      "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\n",
      "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\n",
      "however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\n",
      "his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\n",

      "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\n",
      "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\n",

      "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\n",
      "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n",

      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\n",
      "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\n",
      "not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\n",
      "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\n",
      "would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\n",
      "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\n",
      "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\n",
      "Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\n",

      "\n",
      "“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\n",

      "“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\n",
      "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\n",
      "vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\n",
      "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\n",
      "temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\n",
      "_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\n",
      "over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\n",
      "equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\n",
      "hope, though you have but a short lease.”\n",

      "“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\n",

      "\n",
      "“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\n",
      "the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\n",
      "a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\n",
      "least that advantage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\n",
      "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\n",
      "unvarying society.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\n",
      "observed in them for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\n",
      "country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\n",
      "going on in the country as in town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\n",
      "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\n",
      "victory over him, continued her triumph,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\n",
      "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\n",
      "pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\n",
      "when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\n",
      "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\n",
      "gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\n",
      "at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\n",
      "mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\n",
      "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\n",
      "you must acknowledge to be true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\n",
      "many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\n",
      "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\n",
      "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\n",
      "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\n",
      "saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\n",
      "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\n",
      "William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\n",
      "genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\n",
      "is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\n",
      "important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\n",
      "my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\n",
      "work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\n",
      "judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\n",
      "assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\n",
      "Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\n",
      "has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\n",
      "of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\n",
      "better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\n",
      "partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\n",
      "brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my\n",
      "sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\n",
      "But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\n",
      "wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\n",
      "been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\n",
      "discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\n",
      "strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\n",
      "am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\n",
      "tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\n",
      "speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\n",
      "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\n",
      "unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\n",
      "civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\n",
      "indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\n",
      "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\n",
      "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\n",
      "each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\n",
      "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\n",
      "into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\n",
      "and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\n",
      "affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\n",
      "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\n",
      "attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\n",
      "own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\n",
      "very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\n",
      "ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\n",
      "the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\n",
      "to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\n",
      "your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\n",
      "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\n",
      "wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\n",
      "would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\n",
      "added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\n",
      "Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\n",
      "instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\n",

      "\n",
      "“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”\n",

      "thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\n",
      "think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\n",
      "quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\n",
      "attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\n",
      "you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\n",
      "panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\n",
      "laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\n",
      "undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\n",

      "believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\n",

      "\n",
      "“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\n",

      "dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\n",
      "mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay\n",
      "till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not\n",

      "more than he did himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my\n",
      "friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\n",
      "afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\n",
      "intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\n",
      "circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\n",
      "could.”\n",
      "\n",

      "himself.”\n",

      "but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\n",
      "stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\n",
      "that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\n",
      "the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\n",
      "one argument in favour of its propriety.”\n",

      "either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\n",
      "friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\n",
      "one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\n",
      "one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\n",
      "supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n",
      "circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\n",
      "thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\n",
      "where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\n",
      "very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\n",
      "with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\n",

      "between the parties?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\n",
      "forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\n",
      "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\n",
      "you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\n",
      "myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\n",
      "know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\n",
      "particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\n",
      "when he has nothing to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\n",
      "rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\n",
      "resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\n",
      "brother for talking such nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\n",
      "and want to silence this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\n",
      "Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\n",
      "thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\n",
      "Darcy had much better finish his letter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\n",
      "for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\n",
      "the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\n",
      "way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\n",
      "seated herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\n",
      "Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\n",
      "that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\n",
      "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n",
      "admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\n",
      "he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\n",
      "at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\n",
      "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\n",
      "any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\n",
      "him too little to care for his approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\n",
      "lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\n",
      "opportunity of dancing a reel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\n",
      "surprise at her silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\n",
      "determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\n",
      "that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\n",
      "delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\n",
      "their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\n",
      "you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\n",

      "“Indeed I do not dare.”\n",

      "gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\n",
      "manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\n",
      "never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\n",

      "When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\n",
      "seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\n",
      "where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\n",
      "pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\n",
      "during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\n",
      "of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\n",
      "with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\n",
      "acquaintance with spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\n",
      "something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\n",
      "himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\n",
      "also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\n",
      "and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\n",
      "attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\n",
      "should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\n",
      "to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\n",
      "door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\n",
      "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\n",
      "card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\n",
      "Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\n",
      "petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\n",
      "silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\n",
      "Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\n",
      "sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\n",
      "and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\n",
      "rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\n",
      "Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\n",
      "Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\n",
      "perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\n",
      "could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\n",
      "question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\n",
      "amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\n",
      "second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\n",
      "is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\n",
      "enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\n",
      "book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\n",
      "an excellent library.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\n",
      "cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\n",
      "her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\n",
      "towards him and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\n",
      "Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\n",
      "the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\n",
      "some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\n",
      "pleasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\n",
      "chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\n",
      "thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\n",
      "round my cards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\n",
      "carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\n",
      "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\n",
      "more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\n",
      "near so much like a ball.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\n",
      "the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\n",
      "whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\n",
      "desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\n",
      "turning to Elizabeth, said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\n",
      "turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\n",
      "long in one attitude.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\n",
      "succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\n",
      "up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\n",
      "Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\n",
      "directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\n",
      "he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\n",
      "the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\n",
      "interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\n",
      "meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\n",
      "severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\n",
      "nothing about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\n",
      "anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\n",
      "two motives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\n",
      "as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\n",
      "the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\n",
      "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\n",
      "appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\n",
      "completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\n",
      "as I sit by the fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\n",
      "abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\n",
      "can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\n",
      "as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\n",
      "yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\n",
      "no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\n",
      "ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\n",
      "Darcy may hug himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\n",
      "uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\n",
      "be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\n",
      "laugh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\n",
      "wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\n",
      "be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\n",
      "joke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\n",
      "not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\n",
      "and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\n",
      "laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\n",
      "you are without.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\n",
      "my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\n",
      "understanding to ridicule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such as vanity and pride.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\n",
      "superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\n",
      "“and pray what is the result?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\n",
      "himself without disguise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\n",
      "but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\n",
      "for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\n",
      "convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\n",
      "others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\n",
      "feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\n",
      "would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\n",
      "ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\n",
      "_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\n",
      "really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\n",
      "evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\n",
      "conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\n",
      "waking Mr. Hurst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\n",

      "The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\n",

      "she felt herself to be right.\n",

      "To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\n",
      "Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\n",
      "Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\n",
      "wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\n",
      "should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\n",
      "influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\n",
      "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\n",
      "in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\n",
      "ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\n",
      "received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\n",
      "seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\n",

      "though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\n",
      "the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\n",
      "mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\n",
      "relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\n",
      "Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\n",
      "a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n",
      "\n",

      "understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\n",
      "thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\n",
      "giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\n",
      "connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\n",
      "seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\n",
      "yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\n",
      "four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\n",
      "disagreeable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\n",
      "agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\n",
      "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\n",
      "be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\n",
      "astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\n",
      "anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\n",

      "him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\n",
      "interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\n",
      "their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\n",
      "world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\n",
      "high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\n",

      "not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\n",
      "wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\n",
      "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\n",
      "avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\n",
      "very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\n",
      "His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\n",
      "that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\n",
      "in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\n",
      "thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\n",
      "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\n",
      "everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\n",
      "memory of his father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\n",
      "all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\n",
      "neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\n",
      "had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\n",
      "very intelligible gallantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\n",
      "“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\n",
      "most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\n",
      "further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\n",
      "attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\n",
      "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\n",
      "my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\n",
      "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\n",
      "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\n",
      "was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\n",
      "possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\n",
      "were speaking of just now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\n",
      "living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\n",
      "I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\n",
      "and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n",
      "elsewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\n",
      "will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\n",
      "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\n",
      "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\n",
      "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\n",
      "to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\n",
      "Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\n",
      "was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\n",
      "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\n",
      "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\n",
      "may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\n",
      "freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\n",
      "different sort of men, and that he hates me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\n",
      "can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\n",
      "ever as he expressed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\n",
      "have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\n",
      "attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\n",
      "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\n",
      "attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\n",
      "not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\n",
      "of preference which was often given me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\n",
      "him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\n",
      "despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\n",
      "descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\n",
      "this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\n",
      "remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\n",

      "must be dreadful.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\n",
      "treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\n",
      "father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\n",
      "countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\n",
      "with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\n",
      "childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\n",
      "manner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\n",
      "part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\n",
      "sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\n",
      "father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\n",
      "appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\n",
      "to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\n",
      "Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n",
      "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\n",
      "be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\n",
      "and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\n",
      "voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\n",
      "to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\n",
      "pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\n",
      "motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\n",
      "dishonesty I must call it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\n",
      "traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\n",
      "connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\n",
      "of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\n",
      "impulses even than pride.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\n",
      "freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\n",
      "poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\n",
      "father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\n",
      "degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\n",
      "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\n",
      "which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\n",
      "careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\n",
      "as the most attentive and best of brothers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\n",
      "speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\n",
      "proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\n",
      "of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\n",
      "nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\n",
      "and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\n",
      "home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\n",
      "education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\n",
      "help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\n",
      "who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\n",
      "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\n",
      "know Mr. Bingley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\n",
      "Darcy is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\n",
      "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\n",
      "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\n",
      "very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\n",
      "never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\n",
      "sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\n",
      "something for fortune and figure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\n",
      "the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\n",
      "Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\n",
      "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\n",

      "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\n",
      "reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\n",
      "she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\n",

      "transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\n",
      "particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\n",
      "distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\n",
      "solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\n",
      "without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\n",
      "disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\n",
      "release from him was ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\n",
      "Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\n",

      "her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\n",
      "knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\n",
      "immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\n",

      "“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\n",

      "first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\n",
      "would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\n",
      "she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\n",
      "silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\n",

      "similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\n",
      "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\n",

      "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\n",
      "features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\n",
      "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\n",

      "“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\n",

      "and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\n",
      "feelings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\n",
      "no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\n",
      "something else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\n",
      "with a look of doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\n",
      "thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\n",
      "by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\n",
      "unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\n",
      "created_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\n",
      "to be secure of judging properly at first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\n",
      "to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is your success?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\n",
      "accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\n",
      "greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\n",
      "not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\n",
      "fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\n",
      "opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\n",
      "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\n",
      "silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\n",
      "in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\n",
      "which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\n",
      "with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\n",
      "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\n",
      "questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\n",
      "other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\n",
      "Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\n",
      "implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\n",
      "him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\n",
      "remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\n",
      "most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\n",
      "well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\n",
      "to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\n",
      "could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\n",
      "was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\n",
      "His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\n",
      "I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\n",
      "discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\n",
      "descent, one could not expect much better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\n",
      "said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\n",
      "worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\n",
      "assure you, he informed me himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n",
      "“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\n",
      "you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\n",
      "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\n",
      "Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\n",
      "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\n",
      "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n",
      "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\n",
      "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\n",
      "for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\n",
      "way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\n",
      "sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\n",
      "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\n",
      "you may be sure of my pardon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",
      "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\n",
      "history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\n",
      "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\n",
      "the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n",
      "received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\n",
      "sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\n",
      "afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "regard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",
      "perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\n",
      "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\n",
      "him _conditionally_ only.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\n",
      "“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\n",
      "Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\n",
      "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\n",
      "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\n",
      "both gentlemen as I did before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\n",
      "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\n",
      "delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\n",
      "Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\n",
      "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\n",
      "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\n",
      "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\n",
      "and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\n",
      "as to make a most important discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\n",
      "in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\n",
      "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\n",
      "this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\n",
      "Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\n",
      "have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\n",
      "Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\n",
      "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\n",
      "and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\n",
      "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\n",
      "I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\n",
      "assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\n",
      "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\n",
      "an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\n",
      "was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\n",
      "side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n",
      "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\n",
      "the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\n",
      "speaking, replied thus,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\n",
      "excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\n",
      "understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\n",
      "between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\n",
      "which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\n",
      "the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\n",
      "in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\n",
      "same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\n",
      "dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\n",
      "what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\n",
      "your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\n",
      "though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\n",
      "and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\n",
      "yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\n",
      "reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\n",
      "being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\n",
      "a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\n",
      "hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\n",
      "“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\n",
      "expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\n",
      "unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\n",
      "replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\n",
      "discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\n",
      "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\n",
      "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\n",
      "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\n",
      "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\n",
      "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\n",
      "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\n",
      "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\n",
      "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\n",
      "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\n",
      "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\n",
      "her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\n",
      "very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\n",
      "bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\n",
      "even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\n",
      "saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\n",
      "lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\n",
      "she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\n",
      "one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\n",
      "talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\n",
      "else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\n",
      "Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\n",
      "of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\n",
      "a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\n",
      "were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\n",
      "comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\n",
      "certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\n",
      "was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\n",
      "Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\n",
      "and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\n",
      "consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\n",
      "not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\n",
      "to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\n",
      "occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\n",
      "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\n",
      "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\n",
      "chance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\n",
      "words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\n",
      "whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\n",
      "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\n",
      "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\n",
      "sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\n",
      "nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\n",
      "to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\n",
      "so doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\n",
      "talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\n",
      "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\n",
      "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\n",
      "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\n",
      "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\n",
      "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\n",
      "steady gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\n",
      "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\n",
      "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\n",
      "Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\n",
      "tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\n",
      "had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n",
      "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\n",
      "entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\n",
      "complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\n",
      "opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\n",
      "she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\n",
      "which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\n",
      "amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\n",
      "prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\n",
      "began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\n",
      "her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\n",
      "She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\n",
      "talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\n",
      "signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\n",
      "impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
      "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\n",
      "and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\n",
      "Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\n",
      "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\n",
      "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\n",
      "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\n",
      "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\n",
      "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\n",
      "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\n",
      "music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\n",
      "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\n",
      "an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\n",
      "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\n",
      "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\n",
      "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\n",
      "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\n",
      "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\n",
      "everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\n",
      "cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\n",
      "should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\n",
      "connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\n",
      "his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\n",
      "room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\n",
      "Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\n",
      "having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\n",
      "Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\n",
      "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\n",
      "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\n",
      "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\n",
      "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\n",
      "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\n",
      "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",
      "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\n",
      "she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\n",
      "the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\n",
      "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\n",
      "could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\n",
      "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\n",
      "somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\n",
      "room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\n",
      "to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\n",
      "himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\n",
      "close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\n",
      "project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\n",
      "often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\n",
      "to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\n",
      "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\n",
      "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\n",
      "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\n",
      "manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\n",
      "hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\n",
      "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\n",
      "sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\n",
      "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\n",
      "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\n",
      "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\n",
      "speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\n",
      "sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\n",
      "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\n",
      "nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\n",

      "unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\n",
      "mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\n",
      "of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\n",
      "dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\n",

      "\n",
      "The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\n",

      "he continued,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\n",
      "every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\n",
      "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\n",
      "very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\n",
      "have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\n",
      "recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\n",
      "patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\n",
      "too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\n",
      "left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\n",
      "arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\n",
      "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\n",
      "gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\n",
      "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\n",
      "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\n",
      "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\n",
      "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\n",
      "kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\n",
      "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\n",
      "anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\n",
      "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\n",
      "which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n",
      "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\n",
      "were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\n",
      "assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\n",
      "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\n",
      "father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\n",
      "myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\n",
      "the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\n",
      "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\n",
      "for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\n",
      "flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\n",
      "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\n",
      "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\n",
      "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\n",
      "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\n",
      "in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\n",
      "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\n",
      "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\n",
      "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\n",
      "answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\n",
      "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\n",
      "your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n",
      "hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\n",
      "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\n",
      "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\n",
      "third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\n",
      "just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\n",
      "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\n",
      "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\n",
      "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\n",
      "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\n",
      "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\n",
      "would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\n",
      "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\n",
      "situation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\n",
      "very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\n",
      "disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\n",
      "seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\n",
      "economy, and other amiable qualifications.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\n",
      "give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\n",
      "believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\n",
      "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n",
      "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\n",
      "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\n",
      "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\n",
      "considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\n",
      "spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\n",
      "addressed her,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\n",
      "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\n",
      "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\n",
      "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\n",
      "first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\n",
      "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\n",
      "female character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\n",
      "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\n",
      "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\n",
      "may convince you of its being one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\n",
      "refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\n",
      "believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\n",
      "is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer\n",
      "would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my\n",
      "connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your\n",
      "own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\n",
      "further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\n",
      "by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\n",
      "Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo\n",
      "the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\n",
      "therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\n",
      "shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\n",
      "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\n",
      "of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\n",
      "rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\n",
      "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\n",
      "to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n",
      "forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\n",
      "female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\n",
      "truth from her heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\n",
      "gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\n",

      "being acceptable.”\n",

      "encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\n",

      "\n",
      "“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\n",
      "good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\n",
      "offending your patroness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\n",
      "for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\n",
      "material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\n",
      "displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\n",
      "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\n",
      "and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\n",
      "affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\n",
      "from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\n",
      "your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\n",
      "though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\n",
      "now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\n",
      "my cousin Elizabeth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\n",
      "surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\n",
      "to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\n",
      "her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n",
      "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\n",
      "solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\n",
      "means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\n",
      "improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\n",
      "agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\n",
      "kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\n",
      "private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\n",
      "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\n",
      "that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\n",
      "as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\n",
      "consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\n",
      "she could not help crying out,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\n",
      "story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\n",
      "reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\n",
      "her composure, and calmly replied,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\n",
      "that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\n",
      "because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\n",
      "for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\n",
      "prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\n",
      "wished her all imaginable happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\n",
      "very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\n",
      "But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\n",
      "satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\n",
      "was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\n",
      "character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n",
      "chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\n",
      "entering the marriage state.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\n",
      "they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\n",
      "longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\n",
      "was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\n",
      "unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\n",
      "of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\n",
      "accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\n",
      "not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\n",
      "that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\n",
      "feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\n",
      "most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\n",
      "herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\n",
      "that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\n",
      "she had chosen.\n",

      "when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\n",
      "announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\n",
      "and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\n",

      "Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\n",
      "without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\n",
      "him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\n",
      "truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\n",
      "most forbearing courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\n",
      "a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\n",
      "mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\n",
      "endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\n",
      "by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\n",
      "was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\n",
      "happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\n",
      "of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\n",
      "Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\n",
      "found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\n",
      "the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\n",
      "had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\n",
      "together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\n",
      "inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\n",
      "Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\n",
      "she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\n",
      "points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\n",
      "console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\n",
      "resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\n",
      "scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\n",
      "or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\n",
      "could at all forgive their daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\n",
      "as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\n",
      "it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\n",
      "been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\n",
      "more foolish than his daughter!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\n",
      "less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\n",
      "nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\n",
      "Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\n",
      "clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\n",
      "to spread at Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\n",
      "called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\n",

      "enough to drive happiness away.\n",

      "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\n",
      "mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\n",
      "real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\n",
      "disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\n",
      "sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\n",
      "never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\n",
      "Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\n",
      "the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\n",
      "letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\n",
      "father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\n",
      "twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\n",
      "discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\n",
      "with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\n",
      "affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\n",
      "that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\n",
      "been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\n",
      "Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\n",
      "for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\n",

      "to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\n",
      "and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\n",
      "while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\n",
      "most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\n",
      "gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\n",

      "was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\n",
      "dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\n",
      "frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\n",
      "and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\n",

      "impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\n",

      "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\n",
      "reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\n",
      "first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\n",
      "and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\n",
      "from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\n",

      "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\n",

      "boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\n",

      "could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\n",
      "of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\n",
      "of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\n",

      "     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n",

      "suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\n",

      "they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\n",
      "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\n",
      "lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\n",
      "whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\n",
      "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\n",
      "for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\n",
      "kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\n",
      "shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n",

      "interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\n",
      "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\n",
      "fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\n",
      "the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\n",
      "the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\n",
      "the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\n",
      "bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\n",
      "handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\n",
      "but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\n",
      "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\n",
      "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\n",
      "probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\n",
      "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\n",
      "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\n",
      "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\n",
      "forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\n",
      "Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n",
      "forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\n",
      "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\n",
      "in, observed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\n",
      "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\n",
      "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\n",
      "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\n",
      "service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\n",
      "include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n",
      "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\n",
      "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\n",
      "walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n",
      "_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\n",
      "Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\n",
      "woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\n",
      "telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\n",
      "Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\n",
      "Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\n",
      "and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\n",
      "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\n",
      "pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\n",
      "interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\n",
      "with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\n",
      "for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\n",
      "confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\n",
      "upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\n",
      "the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\n",
      "agitation, cried out,--\n",

      "Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\n",
      "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\n",
      "visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\n",
      "wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\n",
      "doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady\n",
      "Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\n",
      "her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\n",
      "at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\n",
      "it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\n",
      "Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine\n",
      "there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\n",
      "immediately after your arrival?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\n",
      "“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\n",
      "my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\n",
      "instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\n",
      "visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\n",
      "they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\n",
      "so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\n",
      "Elizabeth,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\n",
      "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\n",
      "becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\n",
      "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\n",
      "for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\n",
      "being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n",
      "preserved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\n",
      "doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\n",
      "objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\n",
      "her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\n",
      "who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her\n",
      "introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\n",
      "to his presentation at St. James’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\n",
      "across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\n",
      "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\n",
      "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\n",
      "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\n",
      "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\n",
      "cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\n",
      "increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\n",
      "Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\n",
      "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\n",
      "thought she could witness without trepidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\n",
      "rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\n",
      "the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\n",
      "her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\n",
      "condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\n",
      "with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\n",
      "performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\n",
      "which he would have thought necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\n",
      "awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\n",
      "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\n",
      "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\n",
      "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\n",
      "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\n",
      "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\n",
      "features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\n",
      "conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\n",
      "visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\n",
      "silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\n",
      "marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\n",
      "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\n",
      "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\n",
      "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\n",
      "being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\n",
      "likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\n",
      "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\n",
      "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\n",
      "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\n",
      "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\n",
      "her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\n",
      "admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\n",
      "and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\n",
      "looking at in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\n",
      "and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\n",
      "had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\n",
      "her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\n",
      "nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\n",
      "and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\n",
      "was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\n",
      "manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\n",
      "Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\n",
      "gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\n",
      "to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\n",
      "to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\n",
      "Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\n",
      "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\n",
      "the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\n",
      "little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\n",
      "fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\n",
      "and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\n",
      "done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\n",
      "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\n",
      "subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\n",
      "her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\n",
      "concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\n",
      "to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\n",
      "regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\n",
      "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\n",
      "beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\n",
      "occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\n",
      "Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\n",
      "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\n",
      "the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\n",
      "pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\n",
      "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\n",
      "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\n",
      "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\n",
      "mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\n",
      "questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\n",
      "observed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\n",
      "sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\n",
      "occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\n",
      "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\n",
      "Bennet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\n",
      "instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\n",
      "some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of them does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\n",
      "Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\n",
      "you draw?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, none of you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\n",
      "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has your governess left you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We never had any governess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\n",
      "without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\n",
      "have been quite a slave to your education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\n",
      "been the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\n",
      "have been neglected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\n",
      "wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\n",
      "read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\n",
      "idle certainly might.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\n",
      "known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\n",
      "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\n",
      "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\n",
      "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\n",
      "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\n",
      "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\n",
      "it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\n",
      "was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n",
      "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\n",
      "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\n",
      "Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\n",
      "younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\n",
      "younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\n",
      "be very young?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\n",
      "in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\n",
      "younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\n",
      "amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\n",
      "marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\n",
      "as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\n",
      "not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\n",
      "for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\n",
      "Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\n",
      "and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\n",
      "dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\n",
      "conceal your age.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not one-and-twenty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\n",
      "were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\n",
      "down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\n",
      "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\n",
      "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\n",
      "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\n",
      "expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\n",
      "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\n",
      "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\n",
      "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\n",
      "was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\n",
      "for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\n",
      "Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\n",
      "and noble names.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\n",
      "the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\n",
      "gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\n",
      "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\n",
      "to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\n",
      "arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\n",
      "Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\n",
      "soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\n",
      "cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\n",
      "for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\n",

      "which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\n",
      "Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\n",

      "which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\n",
      "almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\n",

      "to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\n",
      "hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\n",
      "and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\n",
      "these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\n",
      "and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\n",
      "of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\n",

      "particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\n",

      "\n",

      "lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\n",
      "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\n",
      "matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\n",

      "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\n",
      "could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\n",
      "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\n",
      "taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\n",
      "had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\n",
      "arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n",
      "_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\n",

      "said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\n",
      "in an agitated manner, and thus began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\n",
      "repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\n",
      "doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\n",
      "and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\n",
      "followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\n",
      "heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\n",
      "tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\n",
      "degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\n",
      "to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\n",
      "consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\n",
      "suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\n",
      "the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\n",
      "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\n",
      "receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\n",
      "all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\n",
      "answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\n",
      "representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\n",
      "all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\n",
      "expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\n",
      "his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\n",
      "favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\n",
      "countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\n",
      "exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\n",
      "and she said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\n",
      "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\n",
      "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\n",
      "felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\n",
      "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\n",
      "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\n",
      "anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\n",
      "of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\n",
      "the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\n",
      "overcoming it after this explanation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\n",
      "on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\n",
      "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\n",
      "his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\n",
      "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\n",
      "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\n",
      "dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\n",
      "might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\n",
      "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\n",
      "of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\n",
      "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n",
      "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\n",
      "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\n",
      "against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\n",
      "favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\n",
      "the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\n",
      "happiness of a most beloved sister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\n",
      "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\n",
      "continued,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\n",
      "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\n",
      "you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\n",
      "of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\n",
      "world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\n",
      "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\n",
      "kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\n",
      "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n",
      "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\n",
      "that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\n",
      "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\n",
      "kinder than towards myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\n",
      "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\n",
      "is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\n",
      "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\n",
      "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\n",
      "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n",
      "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\n",
      "in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\n",
      "interest in him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\n",
      "misfortunes have been great indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\n",
      "reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\n",
      "have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\n",
      "for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\n",
      "independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\n",
      "all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\n",
      "contempt and ridicule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n",
      "“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\n",
      "thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\n",
      "calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\n",
      "walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\n",
      "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\n",
      "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n",
      "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\n",
      "policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\n",
      "being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\n",
      "reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n",
      "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\n",
      "Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\n",
      "connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\n",
      "condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\n",
      "the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\n",
      "declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\n",
      "concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\n",
      "more gentlemanlike manner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\n",
      "that would have tempted me to accept it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n",
      "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\n",
      "acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\n",
      "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\n",
      "feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\n",
      "disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\n",
      "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n",
      "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\n",
      "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n",
      "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\n",
      "wishes for your health and happiness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\n",
      "the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\n",
      "her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\n",
      "and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\n",
      "astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\n",
      "every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\n",
      "Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\n",
      "so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\n",
      "which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\n",
      "must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\n",
      "incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\n",
      "an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\n",
      "of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\n",
      "acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\n",
      "which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\n",
      "attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\n",
      "attachment had for a moment excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\n",
      "Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\n",
      "Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n",

      "Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\n",
      "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\n",
      "surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\n",
      "else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\n",
      "breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\n",
      "directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\n",
      "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\n",
      "she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\n",
      "park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\n",
      "of the gates into the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\n",
      "tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\n",
      "look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\n",
      "made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\n",
      "verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\n",
      "walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\n",
      "which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\n",
      "now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\n",
      "pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\n",
      "though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\n",
      "towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\n",
      "a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\n",
      "composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\n",
      "meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\n",
      "then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\n",
      "out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\n",
      "Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\n",
      "perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\n",
      "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\n",
      "full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\n",
      "from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\n",
      "its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\n",
      "offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\n",
      "intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\n",
      "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n",
      "effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\n",
      "should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\n",
      "and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\n",
      "your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\n",
      "demand it of your justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n",
      "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\n",
      "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\n",
      "from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\n",
      "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\n",
      "prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\n",
      "wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\n",
      "favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\n",
      "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\n",
      "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\n",
      "persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\n",
      "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\n",
      "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\n",
      "to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\n",
      "their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\n",
      "to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\n",
      "offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\n",
      "be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\n",
      "Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\n",
      "preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\n",
      "it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\n",
      "apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\n",
      "in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\n",
      "you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\n",
      "information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\n",
      "a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\n",
      "event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n",
      "observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\n",
      "that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\n",
      "in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\n",
      "cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\n",
      "regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\n",
      "though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\n",
      "them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\n",
      "here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\n",
      "sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\n",
      "by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n",
      "unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\n",
      "your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\n",
      "acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\n",
      "was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\n",
      "her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\n",
      "investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\n",
      "fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\n",
      "believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\n",
      "My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\n",
      "acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\n",
      "in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n",
      "my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\n",
      "which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\n",
      "instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\n",
      "immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\n",
      "situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\n",
      "comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\n",
      "uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\n",
      "occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\n",
      "you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\n",
      "and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n",
      "consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\n",
      "any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\n",
      "you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\n",
      "disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\n",
      "that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\n",
      "inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\n",
      "friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\n",
      "Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\n",
      "remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\n",
      "now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\n",
      "with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\n",
      "sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\n",
      "shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\n",
      "went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\n",
      "friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\n",
      "earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\n",
      "his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\n",
      "prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\n",
      "I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\n",
      "believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\n",
      "regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\n",
      "dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\n",
      "that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\n",
      "him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\n",
      "given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\n",
      "having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\n",
      "affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\n",
      "condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\n",
      "your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\n",
      "Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\n",
      "have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\n",
      "did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\n",
      "danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\n",
      "done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\n",
      "nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\n",
      "sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n",
      "governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\n",
      "yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\n",
      "accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\n",
      "laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\n",
      "has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\n",
      "shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\n",
      "the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\n",
      "the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\n",
      "to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\n",
      "therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n",
      "afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\n",
      "always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\n",
      "give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\n",

      "highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\n",
      "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\n",
      "since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\n",
      "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\n",
      "guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\n",
      "observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\n",
      "had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\n",
      "could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\n",
      "only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\n",
      "created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\n",
      "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n",
      "died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\n",
      "last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\n",
      "promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\n",
      "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\n",
      "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\n",
      "one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\n",
      "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\n",
      "that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\n",
      "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n",
      "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n",
      "benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\n",
      "must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\n",
      "insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\n",
      "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\n",
      "proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\n",
      "business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\n",
      "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n",
      "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n",
      "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n",
      "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\n",
      "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\n",
      "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\n",
      "dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\n",
      "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\n",
      "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\n",
      "circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\n",
      "were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n",
      "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\n",
      "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\n",
      "doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\n",
      "and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\n",
      "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\n",
      "resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\n",
      "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\n",
      "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\n",
      "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\n",
      "know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\n",
      "notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n",
      "myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\n",
      "to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\n",
      "your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\n",
      "to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\n",
      "myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\n",
      "establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\n",
      "the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\n",
      "Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\n",
      "acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\n",
      "most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\n",
      "recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\n",
      "strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\n",
      "persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\n",
      "was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n",
      "imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n",
      "herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\n",
      "elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\n",
      "and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\n",
      "acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\n",
      "acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\n",
      "exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\n",
      "and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\n",
      "chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\n",
      "thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\n",
      "himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\n",
      "complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\n",
      "which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\n",
      "reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n",
      "towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n",
      "falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\n",
      "wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\n",
      "either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\n",
      "not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\n",
      "told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\n",
      "what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\n",
      "related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\n",
      "still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\n",
      "unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\n",

      "impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\n",

      "struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\n",
      "wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\n",
      "himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\n",
      "with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\n",
      "of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n",
      "_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\n",

      "His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\n",
      "either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\n",
      "his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\n",
      "incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\n",

      "together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\n",
      "that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\n",
      "of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\n",

      "brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\n",

      "everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\n",
      "that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\n",
      "as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\n",

      "congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\n",

      "such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\n",
      "imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\n",
      "be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--\n",

      "of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\n",

      "worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\n",
      "youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of\n",
      "her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n",
      "contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\n",

      "\n",
      "While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\n",
      "rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\n",

      "“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\n",

      "may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\n",
      "him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\n",
      "the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\n",
      "merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\n",

      "woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\n",

      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\n",
      "father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\n",
      "respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\n",
      "herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\n",
      "banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\n",
      "and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\n",
      "children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\n",
      "strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\n",
      "unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\n",
      "from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\n",
      "might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\n",
      "if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\n",
      "other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\n",
      "abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\n",

      "might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\n",
      "of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\n",
      "greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\n",

      "watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\n",
      "has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\n",
      "forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\n",
      "satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\n",
      "name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\n",
      "some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\n",
      "again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\n",
      "present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\n",
      "was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\n",
      "for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\n",
      "and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\n",
      "scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n",

      "“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\n",

      "sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\n",
      "pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\n",

      "When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\n",
      "to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\n",
      "always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\n",
      "they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\n",
      "had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\n",
      "made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\n",
      "she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\n",
      "violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\n",
      "camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\n",
      "to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\n",

      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\n",
      "good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\n",
      "wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\n",
      "came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\n",
      "of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\n",
      "without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\n",
      "hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\n",
      "reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\n",
      "some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\n",
      "should be quartered in Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\n",
      "approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\n",
      "arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\n",
      "curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\n",
      "setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\n",
      "within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\n",
      "far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\n",
      "the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\n",
      "the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\n",
      "present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\n",
      "county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\n",
      "weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\n",
      "town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\n",
      "they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\n",
      "her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\n",
      "Dovedale, or the Peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\n",
      "the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\n",
      "was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\n",
      "and all was soon right again.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\n",
      "impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\n",
      "owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\n",
      "and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\n",
      "before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\n",
      "Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\n",
      "younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\n",
      "Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\n",
      "sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\n",
      "way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\n",
      "morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\n",
      "enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\n",
      "suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\n",
      "inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\n",

      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\n",
      "nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\n",
      "lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\n",
      "sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\n",
      "concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\n",
      "former residence, and where she had lately learned that some\n",
      "acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\n",
      "all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\n",
      "Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\n",
      "was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\n",
      "talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\n",
      "inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\n",
      "willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\n",
      "much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\n",
      "acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\n",
      "Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\n",
      "must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\n",
      "she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\n",
      "richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\n",
      "grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\n",
      "possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\n",
      "occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\n",
      "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\n",
      "a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\n",
      "that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\n",
      "absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",
      "whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\n",
      "proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\n",
      "the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\n",
      "alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\n",
      "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\n",
      "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\n",
      "with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\n",

      "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\n",
      "half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\n",
      "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\n",
      "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\n",
      "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\n",
      "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\n",
      "woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\n",
      "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\n",
      "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\n",
      "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n",
      "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\n",

      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\n",
      "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\n",
      "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\n",

      "which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\n",
      "distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\n",

      "to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\n",
      "suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\n",
      "admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\n",
      "fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\n",
      "furniture of Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\n",
      "these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\n",
      "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n",
      "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\n",
      "herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\n",
      "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\n",
      "absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\n",
      "asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\n",
      "party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\n",
      "not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\n",
      "the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\n",
      "miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\n",
      "she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\n",
      "picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\n",
      "had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\n",
      "army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\n",
      "return it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n",
      "“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\n",
      "other--about eight years ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\n",
      "us whether it is like or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\n",
      "intimation of her knowing her master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, very handsome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\n",
      "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\n",
      "master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\n",
      "be then. He was very fond of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\n",
      "when she was only eight years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\n",
      "accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\n",
      "new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\n",
      "comes here to-morrow with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\n",
      "communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\n",
      "from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\n",
      "master and his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\n",
      "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\n",
      "good enough for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\n",
      "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\n",
      "him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\n",
      "and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n",
      "“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\n",
      "ever since he was four years old.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\n",
      "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\n",
      "Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\n",
      "grateful to her uncle for saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\n",
      "having such a master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\n",
      "meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\n",
      "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\n",
      "was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\n",
      "world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\n",
      "as affable to the poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\n",
      "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\n",
      "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\n",
      "furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n",
      "prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\n",
      "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\n",
      "many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\n",
      "lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\n",
      "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\n",
      "give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\n",
      "saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\n",
      "away like other young men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\n",
      "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\n",
      "sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\n",
      "the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\n",
      "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\n",
      "last at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\n",
      "one of the windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\n",
      "the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\n",
      "can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\n",
      "is nothing he would not do for her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\n",
      "all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\n",
      "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n",
      "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n",
      "Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n",
      "also more intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n",
      "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\n",
      "of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\n",
      "arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\n",
      "such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\n",
      "when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\n",
      "earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\n",
      "gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\n",
      "father’s lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\n",
      "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\n",
      "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\n",
      "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n",
      "considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\n",
      "much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\n",
      "or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\n",
      "the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\n",
      "the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\n",
      "herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\n",
      "than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\n",
      "its impropriety of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n",
      "they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\n",
      "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n",
      "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\n",
      "conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n",
      "suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\n",
      "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\n",
      "instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\n",
      "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\n",
      "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n",
      "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n",
      "of perfect civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n",
      "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
      "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n",
      "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n",
      "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\n",
      "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n",
      "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n",
      "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\n",
      "returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\n",
      "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\n",
      "uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
      "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\n",
      "minutes in which they continued together were some of the most\n",
      "uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\n",
      "spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\n",
      "inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\n",
      "in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n",
      "distraction of his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\n",
      "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n",
      "leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\n",
      "figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\n",
      "feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\n",
      "vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\n",
      "thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\n",
      "disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\n",
      "she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\n",
      "or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\n",
      "only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\n",
      "discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\n",
      "moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\n",
      "again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\n",
      "strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\n",
      "her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\n",
      "family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\n",
      "never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n",
      "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\n",
      "he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\n",
      "account for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n",
      "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n",
      "reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\n",
      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\n",
      "to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
      "was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n",
      "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\n",
      "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\n",
      "her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n",
      "composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n",
      "roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\n",
      "of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\n",
      "the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\n",
      "overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\n",
      "expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\n",
      "beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\n",
      "miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\n",
      "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\n",
      "hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\n",
      "the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\n",
      "the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n",
      "stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\n",
      "it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\n",
      "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\n",
      "returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\n",
      "about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\n",
      "quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\n",
      "sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\n",
      "met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\n",
      "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\n",
      "he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\n",
      "she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\n",
      "got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\n",
      "recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\n",
      "her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\n",
      "no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n",
      "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\n",
      "she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\n",
      "acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\n",
      "revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\n",
      "she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\n",
      "fashion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",
      "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n",
      "it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
      "connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\n",
      "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\n",
      "relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
      "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n",
      "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\n",
      "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n",
      "chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\n",
      "time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n",
      "walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\n",
      "wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\n",
      "compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\n",
      "extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\n",
      "what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\n",
      "work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n",
      "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\n",
      "brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n",
      "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n",
      "Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n",
      "her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n",
      "together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\n",
      "know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n",
      "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n",
      "very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n",
      "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\n",
      "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\n",
      "the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\n",
      "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n",
      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\n",
      "will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\n",
      "who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\n",
      "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\n",
      "between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\n",
      "not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",

      "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\n",
      "there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\n",
      "she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\n",

      "walking slowly towards the house.\n",

      "disagreeable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\n",

      "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\n",

      "warn me off his grounds.”\n",
      "\n",

      "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n",
      "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\n",
      "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\n",
      "good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\n",
      "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\n",

      "relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
      "Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",
      "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\n",
      "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\n",
      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\n",
      "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\n",
      "no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n",
      "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\n",

      "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\n",
      "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\n",
      "curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\n",
      "livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\n",
      "to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\n",
      "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\n",
      "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\n",
      "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\n",

      "Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\n",
      "at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\n",
      "dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\n",
      "her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\n",
      "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",

      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\n",
      "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\n",

      "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\n",
      "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\n",
      "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\n",
      "her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\n",
      "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\n",
      "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\n",
      "was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n",
      "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\n",
      "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\n",
      "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",

      "was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\n",
      "Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\n",
      "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\n",
      "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\n",

      "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\n",
      "each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from\n",

      "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\n",
      "on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\n",
      "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\n",
      "satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\n",
      "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\n",

      "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
      "\n",

      "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\n",

      "\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\n",

      "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\n",
      "from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\n",
      "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\n",
      "would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n",
      "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\n",
      "that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\n",
      "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\n",
      "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\n",
      "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\n",
      "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\n",
      "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\n",
      "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\n",
      "was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\n",
      "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\n",

      "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\n",
      "she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\n",
      "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\n",
      "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\n",
      "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\n",
      "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\n",
      "time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\n",
      "into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\n",
      "favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\n",
      "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\n",
      "there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\n",
      "overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\n",
      "loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\n",
      "petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\n",
      "unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\n",
      "persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\n",
      "accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\n",
      "without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\n",
      "where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\n",
      "opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\n",
      "a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\n",
      "gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\n",
      "such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\n",

      "succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\n",
      "genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\n",
      "of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\n",
      "others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\n",
      "Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\n",
      "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\n",
      "short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\n",
      "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\n",
      "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\n",
      "from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\n",
      "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\n",
      "of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\n",
      "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\n",
      "feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\n",
      "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\n",
      "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\n",
      "Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\n",
      "inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\n",
      "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\n",
      "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\n",
      "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\n",
      "significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\n",
      "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\n",
      "party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\n",
      "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\n",
      "them round the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\n",
      "she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\n",
      "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\n",
      "a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\n",
      "regret that he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\n",
      "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\n",
      "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\n",
      "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\n",
      "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\n",
      "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\n",
      "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\n",
      "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\n",
      "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\n",
      "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\n",
      "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\n",
      "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\n",
      "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\n",
      "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\n",
      "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\n",
      "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\n",
      "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\n",
      "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\n",
      "They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\n",
      "instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\n",
      "various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\n",
      "but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\n",
      "presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\n",
      "she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\n",
      "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\n",
      "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\n",
      "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\n",
      "refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\n",
      "Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\n",
      "her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\n",
      "Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\n",
      "and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\n",
      "that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\n",
      "meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\n",
      "was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\n",
      "her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\n",
      "which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\n",
      "hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\n",
      "meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\n",
      "Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\n",
      "for the welfare of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\n",
      "as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\n",
      "Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\n",
      "to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\n",
      "recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\n",
      "had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\n",
      "fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\n",
      "mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\n",
      "Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\n",
      "person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\n",
      "brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\n",
      "could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\n",
      "Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\n",
      "amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\n",
      "repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\n",
      "never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\n",
      "She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\n",
      "should not have known her again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\n",
      "himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\n",
      "her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\n",
      "summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\n",
      "any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\n",
      "brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\n",
      "character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\n",
      "tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\n",
      "have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\n",
      "extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\n",
      "like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\n",
      "without fashion, which is intolerable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\n",
      "the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\n",
      "wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\n",
      "success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\n",
      "determination of making him speak, she continued,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\n",
      "were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\n",
      "your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\n",
      "a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\n",
      "seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\n",
      "one time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\n",
      "was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\n",
      "considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\n",
      "having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\n",
      "visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\n",
      "both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\n",
      "except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\n",
      "of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\n",
      "himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\n",
      "him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\n",
      "beginning the subject.\n",

      "renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\n",

      "They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\n",

      "written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\n",
      "little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\n",
      "but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\n",
      "agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--\n",

      "“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\n",
      "most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\n",
      "assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\n",
      "An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\n",
      "from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\n",
      "with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\n",
      "surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\n",
      "very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\n",
      "to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\n",
      "Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\n",
      "let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\n",
      "disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\n",
      "Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\n",
      "thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\n",
      "him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\n",
      "twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\n",
      "eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\n",
      "passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\n",
      "him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\n",
      "their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\n",

      "what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\n",
      "other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\n",
      "had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\n",
      "wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\n",
      "head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\n",
      "Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\n",
      "and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\n",
      "and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\n",
      "taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\n",
      "to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\n",
      "day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\n",
      "letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\n",
      "Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\n",
      "never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\n",
      "to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\n",
      "intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\n",
      "no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\n",
      "hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\n",
      "All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\n",
      "London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\n",
      "inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\n",
      "anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\n",
      "and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\n",
      "pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\n",
      "broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\n",
      "I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\n",
      "blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\n",
      "mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\n",
      "circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\n",
      "privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\n",
      "could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\n",
      "which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\n",
      "Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\n",
      "to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\n",
      "hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\n",
      "is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\n",
      "better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\n",
      "my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\n",
      "their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\n",
      "wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\n",
      "something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\n",
      "over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\n",
      "however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\n",
      "again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\n",
      "are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\n",
      "soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\n",
      "afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\n",
      "the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\n",
      "to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\n",
      "his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\n",
      "best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\n",
      "again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\n",
      "assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\n",
      "comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\n",
      "as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\n",
      "moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\n",
      "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\n",
      "impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\n",
      "enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\n",
      "situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\n",
      "I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\n",
      "I have not an instant to lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\n",
      "politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\n",
      "but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\n",
      "not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\n",
      "little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\n",
      "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\n",
      "accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\n",
      "mistress home instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\n",
      "looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\n",
      "or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n",
      "“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\n",
      "present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\n",

      "some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\n",

      "Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\n",
      "that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\n",

      "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\n",

      "marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\n",
      "retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\n",
      "contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\n",
      "feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\n",
      "formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\n",

      "otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\n",
      "unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\n",
      "first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\n",
      "exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\n",
      "somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\n",
      "and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\n",
      "less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\n",
      "with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\n",
      "produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\n",
      "business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\n",
      "hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\n",
      "could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\n",
      "of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\n",
      "letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\n",
      "that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\n",
      "for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\n",
      "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\n",
      "as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\n",
      "suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\n",
      "intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\n",
      "her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\n",
      "prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\n",
      "Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\n",
      "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\n",
      "officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\n",
      "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\n",
      "fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\n",
      "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\n",
      "feel it!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\n",
      "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\n",
      "family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\n",
      "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\n",
      "could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\n",
      "importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\n",
      "was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\n",
      "by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\n",
      "satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\n",
      "cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\n",
      "the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\n",
      "been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\n",
      "deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\n",
      "the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\n",
      "promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\n",
      "less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\n",
      "by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\n",
      "settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\n",
      "done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\n",
      "here when you sent for us;--was it so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n",
      "_That_ is all settled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\n",
      "prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\n",
      "truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\n",
      "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\n",
      "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\n",
      "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\n",
      "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\n",
      "be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\n",
      "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\n",
      "Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\n",
      "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\n",
      "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\n",
      "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n",

      "“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\n",
      "drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\n",
      "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\n",
      "matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\n",
      "such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\n",
      "friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\n",
      "am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\n",
      "would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\n",
      "regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\n",
      "not adequate to the risk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\n",
      "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\n",
      "interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\n",
      "Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\n",
      "him capable of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\n",
      "I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\n",
      "hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\n",
      "case?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\n",
      "that they are not gone to Scotland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\n",
      "presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\n",
      "Barnet road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\n",
      "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\n",
      "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\n",
      "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\n",
      "expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\n",
      "marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\n",
      "friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\n",
      "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\n",
      "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\n",
      "beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\n",
      "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\n",
      "restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\n",
      "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\n",
      "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n",
      "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\n",
      "brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\n",
      "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\n",
      "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\n",
      "do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\n",
      "such a matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\n",
      "as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\n",
      "tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\n",
      "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\n",
      "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\n",
      "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\n",
      "nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n",
      "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\n",
      "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\n",
      "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\n",
      "flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\n",
      "everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\n",
      "greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\n",
      "are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\n",
      "charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\n",
      "Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\n",
      "their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\n",
      "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\n",
      "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\n",
      "sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\n",
      "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\n",
      "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\n",
      "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\n",
      "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\n",
      "such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\n",
      "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\n",
      "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\n",
      "what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\n",
      "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\n",
      "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\n",
      "and Jane seem so well to understand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\n",
      "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\n",
      "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\n",
      "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\n",
      "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\n",
      "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\n",
      "apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\n",
      "neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\n",
      "was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\n",
      "opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\n",
      "be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\n",
      "consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\n",
      "enough from my thoughts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\n",
      "suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\n",
      "side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\n",
      "that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\n",
      "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\n",
      "were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\n",
      "the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\n",
      "attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\n",
      "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\n",
      "who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\n",
      "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\n",
      "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\n",
      "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\n",
      "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\n",
      "find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\n",
      "the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\n",
      "to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\n",
      "expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\n",
      "on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\n",
      "carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\n",
      "faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\n",
      "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\n",
      "hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\n",
      "her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\n",
      "eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\n",
      "heard of the fugitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\n",
      "everything will be well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is my father in town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And have you heard from him often?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\n",
      "that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\n",
      "particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\n",
      "again, till he had something of importance to mention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\n",
      "shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\n",
      "all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\n",
      "Heaven! are quite well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\n",
      "must have gone through!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\n",
      "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\n",
      "engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\n",
      "the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\n",
      "thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\n",
      "had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\n",
      "found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\n",
      "however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\n",
      "deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\n",
      "every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\n",
      "to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\n",
      "conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\n",
      "tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\n",
      "conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\n",
      "blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\n",
      "errors of her daughter must be principally owing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\n",
      "with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\n",
      "had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\n",
      "of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\n",
      "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\n",
      "been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\n",
      "the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\n",
      "child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\n",
      "Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\n",
      "to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\n",
      "in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\n",
      "we shall do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\n",
      "general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\n",
      "that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\n",
      "Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\n",
      "prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\n",
      "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\n",
      "may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\n",
      "and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\n",
      "lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\n",
      "come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\n",
      "together as to what is to be done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\n",
      "could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\n",
      "wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\n",
      "marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\n",
      "tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\n",
      "after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\n",
      "fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\n",
      "out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\n",
      "such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\n",
      "heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\n",
      "Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\n",
      "for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\n",
      "kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\n",
      "in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\n",
      "her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\n",
      "dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\n",
      "housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\n",

      "regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\n",
      "could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\n",
      "terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\n",
      "expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\n",
      "approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\n",
      "engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\n",
      "that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\n",
      "done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\n",
      "arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\n",
      "hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\n",
      "allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\n",
      "through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\n",
      "that sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\n",
      "another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\n",
      "as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\n",
      "of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\n",
      "naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\n",
      "despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\n",
      "its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\n",
      "indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\n",
      "message to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\n",
      "speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\n",
      "philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\n",
      "conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\n",
      "happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\n",
      "farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\n",
      "good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\n",
      "all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\n",
      "in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\n",
      "was considered certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\n",
      "happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\n",
      "spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\n",
      "triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\n",
      "her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\n",
      "accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\n",
      "attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\n",
      "servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\n",
      "proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\n",
      "what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\n",
      "great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\n",
      "too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\n",
      "Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\n",
      "servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\n",
      "daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\n",
      "neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\n",
      "imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\n",
      "soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\n",
      "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\n",
      "daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\n",
      "affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\n",
      "it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\n",
      "resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\n",
      "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\n",
      "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\n",
      "clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\n",
      "shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\n",
      "took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\n",
      "the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\n",
      "her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\n",
      "termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\n",
      "unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\n",
      "spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\n",
      "few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\n",
      "but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\n",
      "frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\n",
      "disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\n",
      "seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\n",
      "concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\n",
      "Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\n",
      "objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\n",
      "kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n",
      "\n",
      "From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\n",
      "wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\n",
      "feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\n",
      "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\n",
      "hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\n",
      "longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\n",
      "seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\n",
      "she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\n",
      "should meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\n",
      "proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\n",
      "have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\n",
      "doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\n",
      "there must be a triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\n",
      "disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\n",
      "temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\n",
      "was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\n",
      "and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\n",
      "and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\n",
      "have received benefit of greater importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\n",
      "connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\n",
      "precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\n",
      "family.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\n",
      "could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\n",
      "a couple who were only brought together because their passions were\n",
      "stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\n",
      "acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\n",
      "promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\n",
      "that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\n",
      "purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\n",
      "on quitting the militia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his\n",
      "marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\n",
      "considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\n",
      "account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\n",
      "Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\n",
      "able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\n",
      "ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\n",
      "an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\n",
      "promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\n",
      "have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\n",
      "written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\n",
      "and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\n",
      "in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\n",
      "pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\n",
      "similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\n",
      "a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\n",
      "hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\n",
      "all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\n",
      "unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\n",
      "leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\n",
      "you and her mother.--Yours, etc.\n",

      "Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\n",
      "removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\n",
      "the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\n",
      "company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\n",
      "Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\n",
      "pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\n",
      "with everybody, and had so many favourites.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\n",
      "to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\n",

      "agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\n",
      "consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\n",
      "urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\n",

      "Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\n",
      "probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\n",
      "them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\n",
      "was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\n",
      "gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\n",
      "been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\n",
      "must endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\n",
      "them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\n",
      "the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\n",
      "anxious, uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\n",
      "she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\n",
      "welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\n",
      "Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\n",
      "alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\n",
      "so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\n",
      "opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\n",
      "enough to provoke him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\n",
      "Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\n",
      "from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\n",
      "length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\n",
      "some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\n",
      "great while since she had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\n",
      "were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\n",
      "exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\n",
      "claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\n",
      "had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\n",
      "down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\n",
      "impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\n",
      "cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\n",
      "colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\n",
      "of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\n",
      "Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\n",
      "with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\n",
      "replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\n",
      "world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\n",
      "voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\n",
      "the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\n",
      "it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things\n",
      "enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\n",
      "I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\n",
      "thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\n",
      "expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\n",
      "which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was\n",
      "afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\n",
      "so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\n",
      "next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\n",
      "window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\n",
      "smiled like anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\n",
      "and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\n",
      "the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\n",
      "anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to\n",
      "her eldest sister,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a\n",
      "married woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\n",
      "from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\n",
      "spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\n",
      "their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\n",
      "each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\n",
      "and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\n",
      "breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\n",
      "charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\n",
      "may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the\n",
      "place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\n",
      "at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\n",
      "You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\n",
      "Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\n",
      "will take care to get good partners for them all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\n",
      "behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\n",
      "winter is over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\n",
      "particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\n",
      "had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\n",
      "his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\n",
      "she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\n",
      "having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\n",
      "all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\n",
      "think than such as did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\n",
      "find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her\n",
      "present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\n",
      "their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\n",
      "than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\n",
      "for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\n",
      "that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\n",
      "if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\n",
      "of having a companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\n",
      "occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\n",
      "everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\n",
      "on the first of September than anybody else in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\n",
      "elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\n",
      "not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\n",
      "curious to hear how it was managed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\n",
      "said on the subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\n",
      "married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\n",
      "that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\n",
      "o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\n",
      "were to meet us at the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\n",
      "you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\n",
      "have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\n",
      "dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\n",
      "sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\n",
      "thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\n",
      "he would be married in his blue coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\n",
      "be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\n",
      "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\n",
      "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\n",
      "fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\n",

      "     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n",
      "     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n",
      "     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n",
      "     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n",
      "     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\n",
      "     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\n",
      "     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\n",
      "     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\n",
      "     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n",
      "     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n",
      "     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\n",
      "     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\n",
      "     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\n",
      "     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\n",
      "     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\n",
      "     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n",
      "     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\n",
      "     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n",
      "     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\n",
      "     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n",
      "     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\n",
      "     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n",
      "     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n",
      "     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n",
      "     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\n",
      "     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n",
      "     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n",
      "     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n",
      "     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n",
      "     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n",
      "     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n",
      "     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\n",
      "     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n",
      "     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n",
      "     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n",
      "     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n",
      "     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n",
      "     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n",
      "     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n",
      "     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n",
      "     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n",
      "     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\n",
      "     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n",
      "     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n",
      "     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n",
      "     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n",
      "     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n",
      "     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\n",
      "     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\n",
      "     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\n",
      "     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\n",
      "     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\n",
      "     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\n",
      "     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\n",
      "     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\n",
      "     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\n",
      "     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\n",
      "     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\n",
      "     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\n",
      "     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\n",
      "     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\n",
      "     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\n",
      "     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\n",
      "     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\n",
      "     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n",
      "     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\n",
      "     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\n",
      "     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\n",
      "     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\n",
      "     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\n",
      "     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n",
      "     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\n",
      "     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n",
      "     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\n",
      "     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\n",
      "     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\n",
      "     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\n",
      "     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\n",
      "     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\n",
      "     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\n",
      "     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\n",
      "     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\n",
      "     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\n",
      "     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\n",
      "     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\n",
      "     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\n",
      "     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\n",
      "     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n",
      "     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\n",
      "     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n",
      "     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\n",
      "     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\n",
      "     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\n",
      "     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n",
      "     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n",
      "     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n",
      "     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n",
      "     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\n",
      "     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n",
      "     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n",
      "     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\n",
      "     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n",
      "     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\n",
      "     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n",
      "     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n",
      "     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n",
      "     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n",
      "     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n",
      "     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\n",
      "     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n",
      "     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n",
      "     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n",
      "     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n",
      "     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n",
      "     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\n",
      "     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n",
      "     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\n",
      "     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n",
      "     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\n",
      "     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\n",
      "     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\n",
      "     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n",
      "     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\n",
      "     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He\n",
      "     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\n",
      "     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n",
      "     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n",
      "     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\n",
      "     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n",
      "     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n",
      "     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n",
      "     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\n",

      "     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n",
      "     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n",
      "     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\n",

      "goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\n",

      "extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\n",
      "on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\n",
      "research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\n",

      "meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\n",
      "most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\n",
      "pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\n",

      "overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\n",

      "how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\n",
      "extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\n",
      "he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\n",
      "it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\n",
      "she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\n",
      "assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\n",
      "materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\n",
      "they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\n",

      "\n",
      "The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\n",
      "forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\n",
      "entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\n",

      "Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\n",

      "\n",
      "“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\n",
      "the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\n",
      "all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\n",

      "at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\n",
      "master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\n",
      "weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\n",
      "Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that\n",
      "I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\n",
      "never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\n",
      "Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\n",
      "is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\n",
      "a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\n",
      "Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\n",
      "to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\n",
      "comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\n",
      "going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\n",

      "Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\n",

      "\n",
      "“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\n",
      "report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\n",
      "any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\n",
      "I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\n",
      "me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\n",
      "alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n",
      "_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\n",
      "Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\n",
      "other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\n",
      "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\n",
      "there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\n",
      "without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\n",

      "\n",
      "In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\n",
      "feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\n",
      "perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\n",
      "more unequal, than she had often seen them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\n",
      "about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\n",
      "will wait on him, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\n",
      "went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\n",
      "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\n",
      "would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\n",
      "Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\n",
      "him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\n",
      "running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\n",
      "on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\n",
      "am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\n",
      "make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\n",
      "husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\n",
      "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n",
      "_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\n",
      "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\n",
      "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\n",
      "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\n",
      "says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\n",
      "is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\n",
      "of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\n",
      "always so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\n",
      "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\n",
      "and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\n",
      "that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\n",
      "seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\n",
      "Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\n",
      "paddock, and ride towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\n",
      "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\n",
      "to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\n",
      "again by her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\n",
      "him before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\n",
      "Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\n",
      "say that I hate the very sight of him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\n",
      "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\n",
      "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\n",
      "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\n",
      "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n",
      "mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\n",
      "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\n",
      "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\n",
      "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\n",
      "him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\n",
      "and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\n",
      "information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\n",
      "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n",
      "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\n",
      "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\n",
      "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\n",
      "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\n",
      "behaviour in Derbyshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\n",
      "minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\n",
      "her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\n",
      "wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\n",
      "enough for expectation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\n",
      "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\n",
      "sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\n",
      "paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\n",
      "gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\n",
      "tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n",
      "symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\n",
      "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\n",
      "had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\n",
      "she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\n",
      "she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\n",
      "mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\n",
      "painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\n",
      "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\n",
      "especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\n",
      "her courtesy and address of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\n",
      "preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\n",
      "hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\n",
      "applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\n",
      "which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\n",
      "was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\n",
      "it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\n",
      "when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\n",
      "bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\n",
      "the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\n",
      "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\n",
      "the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\n",
      "they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\n",
      "with herself for being so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\n",
      "him she had hardly courage to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He readily agreed to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\n",
      "you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\n",
      "it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\n",
      "since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\n",
      "own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\n",
      "seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\n",
      "though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\n",
      "George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\n",
      "syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\n",
      "It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\n",
      "to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\n",
      "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\n",
      "not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\n",
      "continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\n",
      "hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\n",
      "place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\n",
      "know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\n",
      "his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\n",
      "Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\n",
      "deserves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\n",
      "of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\n",
      "the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\n",
      "before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\n",
      "country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\n",
      "“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\n",
      "Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\n",
      "will save all the best of the coveys for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\n",
      "attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\n",
      "flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\n",
      "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\n",
      "that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\n",
      "moments of such painful confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\n",
      "in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\n",
      "that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\n",
      "one or the other again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\n",
      "compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\n",
      "how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\n",
      "lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\n",
      "five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\n",
      "as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\n",
      "unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\n",
      "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\n",
      "that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\n",
      "that she did not always know when she was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\n",
      "intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\n",

      "\n",
      "“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\n",

      "As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\n",
      "or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\n",
      "which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\n",
      "“did he come at all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\n",
      "was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\n",
      "no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\n",
      "no more about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\n",
      "of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\n",
      "better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\n",
      "easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\n",
      "his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\n",
      "seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\n",
      "acquaintance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\n",
      "take care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\n",
      "you as ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\n",
      "the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\n",
      "good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\n",
      "had revived.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\n",
      "who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\n",
      "sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\n",
      "dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\n",
      "the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\n",
      "her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\n",
      "invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\n",
      "hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\n",
      "decided. He placed himself by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\n",
      "bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\n",
      "Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\n",
      "likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\n",
      "alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\n",
      "admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\n",
      "Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\n",
      "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\n",
      "consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\n",
      "gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\n",
      "no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\n",
      "could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\n",
      "such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\n",
      "advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\n",
      "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\n",
      "cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\n",
      "made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\n",
      "and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\n",
      "him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\n",
      "the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\n",
      "bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\n",
      "without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\n",
      "than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\n",
      "uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\n",
      "came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\n",
      "She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\n",
      "chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\n",
      "ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\n",
      "answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\n",
      "where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\n",
      "in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\n",
      "which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\n",
      "the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\n",
      "do we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\n",
      "her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\n",
      "to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\n",
      "being so silly!\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\n",
      "expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\n",
      "protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\n",
      "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\n",
      "himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\n",
      "these three weeks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\n",
      "with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\n",
      "some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\n",
      "to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\n",
      "all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\n",
      "all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\n",
      "mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\n",
      "with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\n",
      "They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\n",
      "nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\n",
      "of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\n",
      "supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\n",
      "others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\n",
      "say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\n",
      "assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\n",
      "venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\n",
      "a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\n",
      "Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\n",
      "were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\n",
      "cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\n",
      "beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\n",
      "what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\n",
      "at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\n",
      "good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\n",
      "girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\n",
      "Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\n",
      "last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\n",
      "humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\n",
      "not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The\n",
      "party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\n",
      "may often meet again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\n",
      "assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\n",
      "agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\n",
      "perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\n",
      "any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\n",
      "greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\n",
      "pleasing, than any other man.”\n",

      "A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\n",
      "friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\n",
      "ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\n",
      "good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\n",
      "expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\n",

      "\n",
      "“Can you come to-morrow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\n",
      "accepted with alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\n",
      "dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\n",
      "dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\n",
      "come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\n",
      "Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\n",
      "Lizzy’s hair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\n",
      "forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\n",
      "where is your sash, my dear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\n",
      "without one of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\n",
      "evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\n",
      "custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\n",
      "five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\n",
      "Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\n",
      "impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\n",
      "Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\n",
      "you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\n",
      "five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\n",
      "suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\n",
      "Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\n",
      "premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\n",
      "few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was forced to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\n",
      "soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\n",
      "my dressing-room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\n",
      "quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\n",
      "into the drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\n",
      "everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\n",
      "daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\n",
      "addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\n",
      "officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\n",
      "forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\n",
      "an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\n",
      "means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\n",
      "between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\n",
      "happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\n",
      "returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\n",
      "persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\n",
      "concurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\n",
      "morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\n",
      "agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\n",
      "or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\n",
      "silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\n",
      "other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\n",
      "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\n",
      "everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\n",
      "write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\n",
      "as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\n",
      "wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\n",
      "she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\n",
      "mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\n",
      "perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\n",
      "if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\n",
      "the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\n",
      "other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\n",
      "_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\n",
      "either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\n",
      "Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\n",
      "whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\n",
      "pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\n",
      "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\n",
      "why is not everybody as happy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\n",
      "delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\n",
      "kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\n",
      "allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\n",
      "said, for the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\n",
      "account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\n",
      "from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\n",
      "know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\n",
      "family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\n",
      "card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\n",
      "with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\n",
      "previous months of suspense and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\n",
      "circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\n",
      "happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\n",
      "father had been short and to the purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\n",
      "and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\n",
      "delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\n",
      "great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\n",
      "to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\n",
      "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\n",
      "expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\n",
      "basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\n",
      "Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\n",
      "Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\n",
      "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\n",
      "her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\n",
      "speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\n",
      "though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\n",
      "Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\n",
      "how really happy he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\n",
      "visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\n",
      "turned to his daughter and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\n",
      "goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\n",
      "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\n",
      "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\n",
      "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\n",
      "easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\n",
      "always exceed your income.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\n",
      "unpardonable in _me_.”\n",

      "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\n",
      "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\n",
      "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\n",
      "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\n",
      "lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\n",
      "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\n",
      "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\n",
      "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\n",
      "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\n",
      "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n",
      "shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\n",
      "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\n",
      "open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\n",
      "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\n",
      "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\n",
      "other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\n",
      "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\n",
      "name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\n",
      "introduction had been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\n",
      "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\n",
      "for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\n",
      "mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n",

      "who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\n",

      "“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\n",
      "summer: the windows are full west.”\n",

      "Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\n",
      "Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\n",
      "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\n",
      "refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\n",
      "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\n",

      "\n",
      "“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\n",
      "different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\n",
      "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\n",
      "Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\n",
      "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\n",
      "decent-looking rooms, walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\n",
      "waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\n",
      "that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\n",
      "conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\n",
      "disagreeable.\n",

      "_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\n",

      "union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\n",
      "accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of\n",
      "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n",
      "the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\n",
      "tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\n",
      "propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\n",
      "earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\n",
      "\n",

      "other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\n",
      "kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\n",
      "Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\n",
      "marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\n",

      "\n",
      "“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\n",

      "_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\n",

      "frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\n",
      "character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\n",
      "How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\n",

      "stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\n",
      "elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\n",
      "patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\n",
      "_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\n",

      "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\n",
      "Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\n",
      "hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\n",
      "appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\n",
      "for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\n",
      "Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\n",
      "their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\n",
      "till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\n",
      "and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\n",
      "expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\n",
      "the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\n",
      "sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\n",
      "Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\n",
      "Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\n",
      "only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\n",
      "looked forward to as possible at some future time.\n",

      "In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\n",
      "feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\n",
      "in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\n",
      "prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\n",
      "application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\n",
      "representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\n",
      "not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\n",
      "aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\n",
      "that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\n",
      "was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\n",
      "whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\n",
      "address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\n",
      "probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\n",
      "and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\n",
      "seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\n",
      "settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\n",
      "unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\n",

      "be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\n",
      "consequent explanations.\n",

      "the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\n",
      "following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\n",
      "before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\n",
      "had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\n",

      "him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\n",
      "affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\n",

      "his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\n",
      "thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\n",
      "allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\n",
      "last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\n",

      "happy with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\n",
      "are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\n",
      "Shall you like to have such a brother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\n",
      "delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\n",
      "really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\n",
      "marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\n",
      "to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\n",
      "tell you all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\n",

      "\n",
      "“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\n",

      "\n",
      "Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\n",
      "desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\n",

      "further to wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I\n",
      "always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\n",
      "must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\n",
      "husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\n",
      "Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\n",
      "tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\n",
      "of it to another, not to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\n",

      "her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\n",
      "conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\n",
      "and half the night spent in conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\n",
      "morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\n",
      "our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\n",
      "coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\n",
      "other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\n",
      "Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\n",
      "way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\n",
      "was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\n",
      "epithet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\n",
      "shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\n",
      "and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\n",
      "hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\n",
      "to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\n",
      "never seen the view.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\n",
      "sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\n",
      "curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\n",
      "consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\n",
      "saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\n",
      "disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\n",
      "all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\n",
      "him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\n",
      "asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\n",
      "application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\n",
      "would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\n",
      "would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\n",
      "were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\n",
      "was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\n",
      "her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\n",
      "first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\n",
      "disapprobation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\n",
      "Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\n",
      "extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\n",
      "be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\n",
      "his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\n",
      "filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\n",
      "reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\n",
      "looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\n",
      "he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\n",
      "pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\n",
      "wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\n",
      "accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\n",
      "reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\n",
      "explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\n",
      "but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\n",
      "of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\n",
      "sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\n",
      "But will they make you happy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\n",
      "indifference?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\n",
      "this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\n",
      "Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\n",
      "know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\n",
      "such terms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\n",
      "of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\n",
      "condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\n",
      "having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\n",
      "disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\n",
      "respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\n",
      "up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\n",
      "greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\n",
      "discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n",
      "_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\n",
      "about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\n",
      "and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\n",
      "object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\n",
      "estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\n",
      "his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\n",
      "months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\n",
      "she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\n",
      "match.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\n",
      "say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\n",
      "you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\n",
      "had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\n",
      "made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\n",
      "his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\n",
      "and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\n",
      "paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\n",
      "way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\n",
      "his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\n",
      "Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\n",
      "at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\n",
      "for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\n",
      "half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\n",
      "the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\n",
      "gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\n",
      "anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\n",
      "would come in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\n",
      "and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\n",
      "for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\n",
      "utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\n",
      "comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\n",
      "was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\n",
      "lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\n",
      "her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\n",

      "“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\n",

      "you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\n",
      "pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\n",
      "dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\n",
      "hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\n",

      "Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could\n",
      "you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\n",

      "\n",
      "“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\n",

      "knew that I _had_ begun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\n",
      "to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\n",
      "to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\n",
      "sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\n",
      "The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\n",
      "attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\n",
      "and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\n",
      "interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\n",
      "amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\n",
      "took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\n",
      "in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\n",
      "courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\n",
      "and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\n",
      "reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\n",
      "of _that_ when they fall in love.”\n",

      "by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\n",

      "to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\n",
      "be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling\n",
      "to come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you\n",

      "called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”\n",
      "\n",

      "_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\n",
      "you _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of\n",
      "thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too\n",
      "much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt\n",

      "\n",
      "“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\n",
      "for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the\n",

      "indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\n",
      "afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly\n",
      "err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more\n",
      "than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to\n",
      "the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the\n",
      "ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the\n",
      "happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\n",
      "before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\n",

      "Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\n",

      "meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\n",
      "saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\n",

      "became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\n",
      "ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s\n",
      "society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham\n",

      "Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\n",
      "drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite\n",
      "unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\n",
      "she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\n",
      "longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,\n",
      "it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\n",
      "much reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\n",
      "the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\n",
      "Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\n",
      "and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\n",
      "everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\n",
      "prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\n",
      "Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\n",
      "his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The\n",
      "letter was to this effect:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     /* “My dear Lizzy, */\n",
      "\n",
      "     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\n",
      "     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\n",
      "     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n",
      "     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n",
      "     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n",
      "     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\n",
      "     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\n",

      "her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\n",
      "Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\n",
      "of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\n",
      "frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\n",
      "income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\n",
      "their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\n",
      "their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\n",
      "herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\n",
      "discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\n",
      "restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\n",
      "extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\n",
      "cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\n",
      "for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\n",
      "in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\n",
      "reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\n",
      "receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him\n",
      "further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\n",
      "her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\n",
      "Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even\n",

      "Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\n",
      "thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\n",
      "dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\n",
      "attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\n",
      "to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\n",
      "was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\n",
      "other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\n",
      "in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\n",
      "astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\n",
      "talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\n",
      "which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\n",
      "pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\n",
      "her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a\n",

      "language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\n",
      "all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\n",
      "he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\n",

      "resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\n",
